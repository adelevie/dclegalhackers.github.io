# Fall 2013 Legal Hackathon 

Last Saturday, October 5, 2013, DC Legal Hackers hosted their first DC Legal Hackathon at [Fastcase](www.fastcase.com).

<p>The [Legal Hackathon](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/) started at 9 am with bagels, meeting, and greeting. [Participants](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/Participants.md) included familar faces from the [Issue Spotting happy hour](http://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/131895222/), the Hypothes.is and Open Gov Foundation [Legal Annotation Roundtable](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/Open-Government-Annotation-Gathering), and Code for DC, as well as first time #LegalHackers, including DC's Open Govermentment Director, law students, and local law/tech community. 
The [Agenda](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/Agenda.md) was fairly flexible with a [GitHub 101](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/GitHub101.md) session for non-techies hosted by DC Legal Hackers Co-organizer, and major proponent of this hackathon, Ben Balter. For more information on how to start with GitHub, check out our [sign up guide](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/GitHub101.md), or [Ben's presentation](http://ben.balter.com/open-sourcing-government/#/git), his [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary) (created the day before at the annotation roundtable), [tryGit](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) with Code School or if all else fails, [ask Ben](https://github.com/benbalter/feedback) himself:</p>

<p>After the GitHub 101 introduction for non-techies, the tables were turned, with a Legal Access 101 presentation for techies, featuring Jessie Posilkin and Glenn Rawdon from Legal Services Corporation who explained the overarching access to justice issue as well as Legal Services Corporation's mapping problem. LSC's problem issue: As it stands, the LSC search tool only offers the ability to search on the basis of state and county. Because counties can be very large, and sometimes the LSC service areas are not drawn on a county basis, the search function is not as helpful as it can be (and in some cases leads to confusing results). See [Massachusetts](http://grants.lsc.gov/about-grants/where-we-fund/massachusetts) for an example. Ideally, the search tool would be able to take a zip code as input and return the nearby locations in the assigned service area. In this hackathon, we will use the underlying mapping data that LSC has on file to create new and helpful ways for low-income individuals to search for their appropriate LSC location. An example for improvement is [Stateside Legal](http://statesidelegal.org/statesidemap). LSC's Access to Justice project was chosen beforehand as a project to feature at the hackathon because it was a specific problem with technical and non-technical components. In addition to creating a [DC Legal Hackers website](dclegalhackers.github.io), the following projects were hacked on: [LSC Mapping](https://github.com/LegalServicesCorporation/LSC-Mapping/blob/master/README.md), [DC Procurement Scraping](https://github.com/vzvenyach/dc-contracts), [US Glossary Annotation project](https://github.com/unitedstates/glossary), [new DC Code Parsing](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded), [Legal Cititaton Linker in Markdown](https://github.com/adelevie/citation-linker), [Stackedit fork for legislative drafting](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/stackedit). See more information about how those projects turned out below. After the hacking, the gang went out for celebratory drink. Not a first hackathon! 
Check out the great round ups from our co-conspirators, [Open Gov Foundation](http://opengovfoundation.tumblr.com/post/63569079653/dc-legal-hackers-inaugural-hackathon-october-5), and US Glossary Annotator, [Eric Mill](https://www.konklone.com/post/legal-hacking-in-dc), as well.</p>

### Projects Hacked On  

#### [LSC Mapping](https://github.com/LegalServicesCorporation/LSC-Mapping/blob/master/README.md)

#### [DC Procurement Scraping](https://github.com/vzvenyach/dc-contracts)  

David Zvenyach, chief counsel for the DC Council, and major proponent of the [DC Code project](www.dccode.org) worked on a Python scraper for DCâ€™s contracts, gathering procurement data, improving the searchability, and most importantly creating peramlinks for contract information that after fulfilled leaves the current DC site. 

#### [US Glossary Annotation project](https://github.com/unitedstates/glossary)  

Eric Mill, along with Lindsay Young, Erroll Grannum, and Keith Leonard (of Fastcase) worked on a glossary the Unite States project on GitHub. A tool where lawyers and non-techies alike can through Prose.io define legal terms and then have those definitions turned into data and applied to synced apps.

#### [new DC Code Parsing](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded)  

In addition to assisting Legal Services Corporation on their map quest :), Tom Macwright sought assistance on updating [DCCode.org](www.dccode.org) by creating a new parser for the newest code edition. To read more about the DC Code project, see Tom's eureka [moment](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html) and Robert Richard's [fanastic timeline](http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/freeing-the-dc-code/) of how the code was freed. 

#### [Legal Cititaton Linker in Markdown](https://github.com/adelevie/citation-linker)

DC Legal Hacker co-organizer, Ruby programer, and 3L, Alan deLevie, wrote a tool to autolink legal citations, using Eric Mill's unitedstates/citation parser as a foundation.

#### [Stackedit fork for legislative drafting](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/stackedit)

<img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/ba91e8583bb4d59f827660421ffe3f68/tumblr_muexg6SkcN1s13242o3_1280.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

Open Gov Foundation forked StackEdit to devise a Markdown-based format for legal drafting.
