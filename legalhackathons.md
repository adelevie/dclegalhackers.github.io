<p>The [Legal Hackathon](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/) started at 9 am with bagels, meeting, and greeting. [Participants](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/Participants.md) included familar faces from the [Issue Spotting happy hour](http://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/131895222/), the Hypothes.is and Open Gov Foundation [Legal Annotation Roundtable](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/Open-Government-Annotation-Gathering), and Code for DC, as well as first time #LegalHackers, including DC's Open Govermentment Director, law students, and local law/tech community. 
The [Agenda](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/Agenda.md) was fairly flexible with a [GitHub 101](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/dclegalhackathon/blob/master/GitHub101.md) session for non-techies hosted by DC Legal Hackers Co-organizer, and major proponent of this hackathon, Ben Balter. For more information on how to start with GitHub, check out our sign up guide, or Ben's presentation, his GitHub glossary (created the day before at the annotation roundtable), tryGit with Code School or if all else fails, ask Ben himself:

After the GitHub 101 introduction for non-techies, the tables were turned, with a Legal Access 101 presentation for techies, featuring Jessie Posilkin and Glenn Rawdon from Legal Services Corporation who explained the overarching access to justice issue as well as Legal Services Corporation's mapping problem. LSC's problem issue: As it stands, the LSC search tool only offers the ability to search on the basis of state and county. Because counties can be very large, and sometimes the LSC service areas are not drawn on a county basis, the search function is not as helpful as it can be (and in some cases leads to confusing results). See [Massachusetts](http://grants.lsc.gov/about-grants/where-we-fund/massachusetts) for an example. Ideally, the search tool would be able to take a zip code as input and return the nearby locations in the assigned service area. In this hackathon, we will use the underlying mapping data that LSC has on file to create new and helpful ways for low-income individuals to search for their appropriate LSC location. An example for improvement is [Stateside Legal](http://statesidelegal.org/statesidemap).

#### [new DC Code Parsing](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded)  

"David Zvenyach, chief lawyer for the DC Council, continued his personal transformation into a role model for government lawyers everywhere by working on a Python scraper for DCâ€™s procurement contracts. In case you forgot, Zvenyach is also the one responsible, on the government side, for opening the DC Code back in April."

"The team at the Open Gov Foundation forked StackEdit to devise a Markdown-based format for legal drafting. Alan deLevie wrote a tool to autolink legal citations inside it, using my unitedstates/citation parser as a foundation."
