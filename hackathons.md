## Fall 2013 Access to Justice Legal Hackathon Projects

#### [Legal Services Corporation Mapping](https://github.com/LegalServicesCorporation/LSC-Mapping/blob/master/README.md)

Legal Services Corporation offers civil legal services to low-income individuals on the basis of particular "service areas," which are defined on the basis of county, city, town, or other lines, as defined by Congress. LSC providers have locations within these services areas, and are only allowed to provide legal services within those areas. Therefore, it's important for low-income individuals to know which LSC locations can serve them (and, relatedly, which of those locations is closest to them). As it stands, the LSC search tool only offers the ability to search on the basis of state and county. Because counties can be very large, and sometimes the LSC service areas are not drawn on a county basis, the search function is not as helpful as it can be (and in some cases leads to confusing results). During the hackathon, DC Legal Hackers and lSC staff opened up the underlying Legal Services mapping data to create new and helpful ways for low-income individuals to search for their appropriate LSC location.

#### [DC Procurement Scraping](https://github.com/vzvenyach/dc-contracts)  

David Zvenyach, chief counsel for the DC Council, worked on a Python scraper for DCâ€™s contracts, gathering procurement data, improving search-ability, and most importantly creating permalinks for contract information that previously left the site after the contract was completed. This project makes it easier to search for DC contract information for potential legal issues and provides additional accountability and transparency to the financial proceedings of DC.  

#### [US Glossary Annotation project](https://github.com/unitedstates/glossary)  

Eric Mill, along with Lindsay Young, Erroll Grannum, and Keith Leonard (of Fastcase) worked on a glossary the Unite States project on GitHub. A tool where lawyers and non-techies alike can through Prose.io define legal terms and then have those definitions turned into data and applied to synced apps.

#### [*New* DC Code Parsing](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded)  

In addition to assisting Legal Services Corporation on their map quest, Tom Macwright sought assistance on updating [DCCode.org](www.dccode.org) by creating a new parser for the newest code edition. To read more about the DC Code project, see Tom's eureka [moment](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html) and Robert Richard's [fantastic timeline](http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/freeing-the-dc-code/) of how the code was freed.  

#### [Stackedit fork for legislative drafting](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/stackedit)

Open Gov Foundation forked StackEdit to devise a Markdown-based format for legal drafting.
