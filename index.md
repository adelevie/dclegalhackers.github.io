##About
Legal Hackers explore and develop creative solutions to some of the most pressing issues at the intersection of technology and law through Meetups, conferences, workshops, and hackathons. We spot issues and opportunities where technology can improve and inform the practice of law and where law can adapt to rapidly changing technology. 
We explore; we discuss; we create. We are Legal Hackers. We are the DC Chapter.
