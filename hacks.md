During the hackathon LSC, and hackers, including Tom Macwright, converted service area shapefiles to open/web-friendly geoJSON and plotted service centers, to create new and helpful ways for low-income individuals to search for their appropriate LSC location. LSC signed up for their first GitHub account during the hackathon:

#### [DC Procurement Scraping](https://github.com/vzvenyach/dc-contracts)  

David Zvenyach, chief counsel for the DC Council, worked on a Python scraper for DCâ€™s contracts, gathering procurement data, improving their search-ability (including lawyer information), and most importantly creating permalinks for contract information that left the site after the contract was completed. This project practically makes it easier to search DC contract information for potential legal issues and provides additional accountability and transparency to the financial proceedings of DC.

#### [US Glossary Annotation project](https://github.com/unitedstates/glossary)  

Eric Mill, along with Lindsay Young, Erroll Grannum, and Keith Leonard (of Fastcase) worked on a glossary the Unite States project on GitHub. A tool where lawyers and non-techies alike can through Prose.io define legal terms and then have those definitions turned into data and applied to synced apps.

#### [*New* DC Code Parsing](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded)  

In addition to assisting Legal Services Corporation on their map quest, Tom Macwright sought assistance on updating [DCCode.org](www.dccode.org) by creating a new parser for the newest code edition. To read more about the DC Code project, see Tom's eureka [moment](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html) and Robert Richard's [fantastic timeline](http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/freeing-the-dc-code/) of how the code was freed.
