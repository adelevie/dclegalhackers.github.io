   "body":"## DC Legal Hackers \r\n\r\nTechnology bustles ahead, but our legal tools and tech related policy hardly reflect this. What gives? This monthly meetup challenges Legal Hackers to catch legal tools and policy up with technology. Join us as we tackle these tough problems and create tangible solutions, through: discussions, speakers, demos, lessons (yes, coding), and quarterly hackathons. There are two requirements to be Legal Hacker; all you need is attention and analytical curiosity. Our discussions will be aimed at creating proposed resolutions on the spot, so bring your brains and your portable computing devices! \r\n\r\n## Monthly Meetup Events \r\n\r\n## Legal Hackathons \r\n\r\nWhat's a \"legal hackathon\"?\r\n\r\nA legal hackathon is an event that brings together teams of lawyers, policymakers, academics, and technologists to develop innovative, on-the-spot solutions to challenging legal issues. The hackathon will present a unique problem (here: Access to Justice) for legal hackers to solve, with topics ranging from current policy debates to the role of technology in legal practice and policymaking. During the legal hackathon, the teams will work together on a tech- or policy-based solution to the issue presented. Although you don't have to be a coder to participate, we strongly encourage non-tech participants to work together with coders on their \"legal hacks.\" \r\n\r\n## Projects \r\n\r\n* GitHub 101 \r\n* Access to Justice [fixing LSC's map]\r\n* \r\n\r\n### Members \r\n\r\n### Sponsors & Friends \r\n* [Code for DC](http://www.codefordc.org)\r\n* [GitHub](http://www.github.com) (meta)\r\n",
